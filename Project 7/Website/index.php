      <p>So, this is my first ever website! This is all pretty exciting. As for what I want
      to turn this website into, I have no idea. Maybe make a website that will be all
      about clouds. Clouds are cool.</p>

      Here is a photo of a cloud!<br/>

      <p>Clouds appear white because of scattering. The droplets in clouds are big compared to the wavelength of
      light, so all wavelengths scatter the same. It's a different story for the scattering of light from
      molecules of air in the atmosphere.</p>

      <img src="Images/Morning_Sky_7.jpg" width="30%"/><br/>

      <p>This is why light scattered by clouds takes on the same color as the incoming light. For example, clouds
      will appear white or gray at midday and orange or red at sunrise or sunset. In this way,
      clouds act as a screen on which nature's colors are painted.</p>

      <ul id="List">
        <li>The highest clouds in the atmosphere are cirrocumulus, cirrus, and cirrostratus.</li>
        <li>Mid-level clouds include altocumulus and altostratus.</li>
        <li>The lowest clouds in the atmosphere are stratus, cumulus, and stratocumulus.</li>
      </ul>
